# Welcome to the EledgerUser Repository!!

This Repository contains all the user management APIs for lenders and customers. This user management project is used with two different projects(repositories):
* [Eledger Api](https://github.com/royforge/eledgerapi) is for Backend.
* [Eledger UI](https://github.com/royforge/eledgerui) is for Frontend.

All these 3 projects are combined to make a single Project Eledger. So, EledgerUser is an part of these repositories.

The main use of these user management APIs is to create a new lender(signup), login, add new customer, update the customer, update the lender, get list of lender by lenderId, get list of customer by lenderId, get lender by userId, get customer by userId, delete a customer. These are the APIs created in this project. 

This. is an Maven project. The REST APIs are created using Spring Boot, Java And some other frameworks(mentioned in pom.xml file). This wiki will take you to every detailed steps of how to clone this project and start the server. Every API will be explained in detail in next pages.
